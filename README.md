# Bootstrap-Boilerplate 1.0.0
A basic template for a bootstrap project

Bootstrap Boilerplate is a theme-template for designing a wordpress theme using git, grunt and sass in the workflow.  There are many projects similar to this one, but this one is my own learning project.  I'm sure there will be some sloppy coding and substandarding scripting.  However at the end of it, I hope to have learned something. 

My goal is to explore other options such as Bourbon, Compass, Gulp - to name a few - but seem to have a decent if not basic handle on Grunt and Sass as I start this project.

## 1. Installation
1. Ensure node.js and Ruby are installed and up to date.
2. Clean install wordpress into a folder called bootstrap_dev
3. Clone BB into bootstrap_dev\wp-content\themes\
4. npm install --save-dev to ensure package.json dependencies are installed to theme directory
5. Design and Develop

### todo
- package.json
- grunt-file.js
- .gitignore
