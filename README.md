# Bootstrap-Boilerplate 1.0.0
A basic template for a bootstrap project

Bootstrap Boilerplate is a theme-template for designing a wordpress theme using Git, Grunt and Sass in the workflow.  There are many projects similar to this one, but this one is my own learning project.  I'm sure there will be some sloppy coding and substandarding scripting.  However at the end of it, I hope to have learned something. 

My goal is to explore other options such as Bourbon, Compass, Gulp - to name a few - but seem to have a decent if not basic handle on Grunt and Sass as I start this project.  I also would like to try other responsive grid systems with sass like Neat or Susy which would not require the bootstrap structure and so would use underscores wich is already sass ready.  Having written this much, I believe that I will create a sister project called something similar but based on the underscores structure.
