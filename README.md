# Bootstrap-Boilerplate 1.0.0
A basic template for a bootstrap project

Bootstrap Boilerplate is a theme-template for designing a wordpress theme using git, grunt and sass in the workflow.  There are many projects similar to this one, but this one is my own learning project.  I'm sure there will be some sloppy coding and substandarding scripting.  However at the end of it, I hope to have learned something.

1. Clean install wordpress into a folder called bootstrap_dev
2. Clone BB into bootstrap_dev\wp-content\themes\
